#Q.1 -> Combine the datasets (Emp and Dept) and create a dataset which  has department name and location along with 
#employee information 

#Q.2 -> Find the average salary by location.

#Q.3 -> Create a dataset which has name of employee along with its manager name and find the manager who has the most
#direct reportees

#Q.4 -> If salary increment across levels are given (as in question), what would be the salary after increment
